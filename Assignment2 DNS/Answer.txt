Question: Use the internet to research DNSSEC.  What differences are there between DNS and DNSSEC, and how does DNSSEC improve security?

Answer: 
DNSSEC is a security extension to the DNS. 

Difference:
- The attirbute inherent to DNS protocal can't defend any cyberattacks, it can't check authority of the server and content query responses or if there is any modification to the responses.
- Whereas DNSSEC validates responses to DNS queries before returning them to the client device. DNSSEC uses digital signatures stored in name servers alongside common DNS record types.
At the center of DNSSEC is a public-private key pair. Each DNS zone has a public key and a private key. Public key cryptography is the starting point for DNSSEC validation. Available to everyone, a public key provides the means to decrypt messages signed by a corresponding private key.
With DNSSEC enabled during an attempted man-in-the-middle attack, the validating resolver rejects the response from a rogue server because it does not have the cryptographic data that validates its origins. The resolver does not return the fake response to the client.

How DNSSEC improve security:
- Data origin authentication allows a resolver to cryptographically verify that the data it received actually came from the zone where it believes the data originated.
- Data integrity protection allows the resolver to know that the data hasn't been modified in transit since it was originally signed by the zone owner with the zone's private key.
